# Articles and Blog Posts Written - by Prof Cyber Naught

UPDATE NOTICE: This needs rethinking as the additional workload when creating articles and blog posts is tedious.

Here is a default repository for any articles or blog posts written by Prof Cyber Naught. These could be posted on other platforms such as personal blogs, guest posts and articles, and social media platforms such as Mastodon.

You can view the blog by visiting the following link:

I do not have Mastodon on my phone and only check when I am sat at my workstation at home. I do not use Twitter or Facebook so these are not additional options.

## Here is my attempt to introduce myself in a light-hearted manner:

Hey there!

I'm a jack of all trades, trying to be a master of some. I've taught mathematics to students at university, ran a professional music studio where I helped aspiring musicians bring their talents to the world, and even started my own IT business consultancy providing tech solutions, privacy audits, and general business strategic planning.

But that's not all, I have degrees in Psychology, and Law, along with Post Grad in Management, have an interest in how the #hacker mind works, and attended an 18 week #cybersecurity #bootcamp (yes, I am one of those). I have many other qualifications but there are too many to list here.

I'm also a tech geek who loves to get involved in code (PHP being my fav) and staying on top of the latest in cybersecurity and privacy. I started coding when I was 8 years of age on the old Amstrad 464 with a green CRT monitor!

When I'm not working, you can find me (well, maybe not) exploring nature on a countryside walk (I can be gone all day) or diving into a good book (interests in privacy, security, positive psychology, and fictional recreations of Roman battles). Basically, I like to keep things interesting and have my mind pondering about many different things.

Looking forward to connecting with you all, and I have started a blog if you're interested:

By the way, I've never been a #Twit' ter lover and can handle a little #toot now and then. Never been a avid user of social media but looking to connect.
