# Cybersecurity: What Colour Hacker Would You Be?

## Technical skills to exploit vulnerabilities

Hackers are individuals or groups who use their technical skills to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and software. While the term "hacker" often carries a negative connotation, there are actually different types of hackers with varying motivations and methods.

Black hat hackers are the ones most commonly associated with the negative connotations of the term "hacker." These are individuals or groups who use their skills to gain unauthorised access to computer systems and steal sensitive information, disrupt services, or spread malware. Their actions are illegal and they are typically motivated by financial gain or a desire to cause harm.

Grey hat hackers fall somewhere in between black hat and white hat hackers. These individuals may use their skills to gain unauthorised access to computer systems, but they do so with the intention of identifying and reporting vulnerabilities rather than stealing information or causing harm. They may also use their skills to test the security of their own systems. While their actions may technically be illegal, many grey hat hackers believe that their actions are justified in the interest of improving security.

White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, use their skills to identify and report vulnerabilities in computer systems with the goal of improving security. These individuals or groups are often employed by organisations to test the security of their systems, and their actions are legal and ethical.

It's important to understand the different types of hackers and their motivations. While black hat hackers use their skills for illegal and harmful purposes, grey hat and white hat hackers use their skills to improve security and protect against unauthorised access. It's important to also note that being a hacker is not limited to these 3 categories, there are other types of hackers as well.
