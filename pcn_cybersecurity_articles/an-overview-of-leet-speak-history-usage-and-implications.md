# An Overview of Leet Speak: History, Usage, and Implications

## Substitution, special codes, and secret speak

Leet Speak, also known as 1337 speak or leetspeak, is a form of online slang that substitutes letters in words with numbers and special characters. It originated in the early days of the internet as a way for hackers and gamers to communicate in secret. According to Raymond (1996), Leet Speak was first used by hackers as a form of online shorthand, allowing them to communicate with each other in a way that was difficult for outsiders to understand.

Leet Speak level 1 typically replaces letters with numbers that resemble them, such as "e" with "3" or "a" with "4". For example, the word "hello" would be written as "h3ll0". This substitution of letters with numbers and special characters is also known as "Leetification" (Kamvar, et al, 2003).

ASCII characters are used to represent letters, numbers, and special characters in Leet Speak. These characters are represented by a unique code, and can be used to create a variety of different symbols and letters. According to [Asciitable.com](http://asciitable.com/ "Asciitable.com") (n.d.), the ASCII character set consists of 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control codes.

Leet Speak can be used in a variety of ways, such as in online gaming, social media, and in online forums. However, it is important to note that using Leet Speak can make text harder to read and can impede effective communication. According to Steinkuehler (2006), Leet Speak can create a barrier to communication between members of an online community and also create a sense of exclusivity.

One of the main reasons for its usage is that, it was used to circumvent online text filters used in forums, games, online chats, and other commonly known services. This is because text filters in these services are often programmed to block certain words or phrases, and by using Leet Speak, users can bypass these filters and post content that would otherwise be blocked. According to Bruns (2008), the use of Leet Speak can make it difficult for online platforms to monitor and censor potentially harmful content.

One of the important things to note is that Leet Speak should not be used for passwords. This is because the use of numbers and special characters makes passwords more vulnerable to brute force attacks, where an attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters in order to gain access to an account. According to NIST (2016), using Leet Speak in passwords can increase the risk of a security breach and make it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive information. Instead, use strong passwords with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters and make sure to change it periodically.

In conclusion, Leet Speak is a form of online slang that originated in the early days of the internet. It can be used in a variety of ways, but it should not be used in situations where clear communication is important. Furthermore, it should not be used for passwords as it makes them more vulnerable to brute force attacks. 

Additionally, it was used to circumvent online text filters used in forums, games, online chats, and other commonly known services.
