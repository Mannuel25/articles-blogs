# Coding Focus: Programming or Scripting Languages - What is the Difference?

A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax that is used to create software programs and applications. Examples of popular programming languages include C++, Java, and Python.
A scripting language, on the other hand, is a type of programming language that is used to write scripts, which are small programs that automate tasks on a computer. Examples of popular scripting languages include JavaScript, Perl, and Python.
The main difference between a programming language and a scripting language is the way they are used. Programming languages are used to create stand-alone applications that can be executed on a computer, while scripting languages are used to automate tasks within other programs or applications.
For example, C++ is a programming language that can be used to create a stand-alone game or desktop application. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that is commonly used to add interactive elements to websites, such as form validation and dynamic content.
Another example is that Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to create stand-alone applications, but it also has libraries that make it a great scripting language for automating tasks such as data analysis, web scraping, and machine learning tasks.
In summary, a programming language is used to create software programs and applications, while a scripting language is used to automate tasks within other programs or applications. Both have their own use cases and are important tools in the software development industry.
