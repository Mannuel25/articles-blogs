<!-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

You can use this template to copy your chosen article data. Editors have find and replace functions and you can use these features to replace all instances of a particular variable code. However, it might be easier just copying your data fields into the areas replacing content between the square brackets; also removing a single instance of the square brackets (based on lack of repeated variable codes).

Example of replacing variable codes:

Example 1:
Original: Test content [EXAMPLE-CODE-HERE] has been copied.
Replaced: Test content new data here has been copied.

Example 2:
Original: Here is [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]], a contributor.
Replaced: Here is [ProfCyberNaught], a contributor.

HELPFUL HINT: If you look at example 2, the 'replaced' text still has square brackets because the 'variable code' was placed between square markdown brackets to begin with. It is important to make sure you do not accidentally remove markdown square brackets when they are needed for layout requirements.

There are two locations within this template where this would apply: [[ARTICLE-TITLE]] and [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]
These two items when replaced should look similar to these examples: [This is a great article] and [ProfCyberNaught]

Here is a list of variable codes used:

[ARTICLE-TITLE] (required) (x3)
[ARTICLE-SUBTITLE] (required) (x1)
[ARTICLE-CONTENT] (required) (x1)
[KEYWORD-1] (required) (x1)
[KEYWORD-2] (required) (x1)
[KEYWORD-3] (required) (x1)
[KEYWORD-4] (required) (x1)
[KEYWORD-5] (required) (x1)
[REFERENCE-1] (optional 'as per article') (x1)
[REFERENCE-2] (optional 'as per article') (x1)
[REFERENCE-3] (optional 'as per article') (x1)
[REFERENCE-4] (optional 'as per article') (x1)
[PUBLISHED-DATE] (required) (x1)
[COPIED-OVER-DATE] (required) (x1)
[YOUR-GITHUB-URL-USERNAME] (required) (x2)
[YOUR-GITHUB-URL] (required) (x1)
